  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/matt.might.net/articles/bash-by-example/images/bash-shell.png" />
  <p>A shell is a program that runs in a terminal. A terminal is simply a program that opens up a window in which you can interact with the shell. A shell
    takes in commands from a user and gives them to an operating system to execute. The results are then displayed in the terminal. Codyshell is based on the shell bash.</p>
